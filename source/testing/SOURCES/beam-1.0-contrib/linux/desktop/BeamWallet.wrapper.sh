# This sets some needed environment variables and allows for some
# experimentation. Why? Because, for example, QT5 + GNOME + Wayland do not work
# well just yet, unfortunately. So, we, by default failback to x11. 

# Now, QT programs already do this, but they generate an error that looks like this:
#   "Warning: Ignoring XDG_SESSION_TYPE=wayland on Gnome. Use QT_QPA_PLATFORM=wayland to run on Wayland anyway."
# We control that explicitely here so that the error doesn't crop up.

# Note: beam.desktop will call this script instead of the raw beam-wallet
# executable.

# Note, if you change these values they will last as long as the package
# manager doesn't replace this file (which it does in most cases).

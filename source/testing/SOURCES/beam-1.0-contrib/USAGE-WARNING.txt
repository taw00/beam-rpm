This was announced on Beam's community discord on Jan 10, 2018. A warning
concerning use of Beam core' (the reference client's) wallet software.

"""
@everyone WHAT NOT TO DO WITH BEAM WALLET (UPDATED)
(short guidelines on how to avoid many many problems)

The following instructions apply to Beam private users and organizations such
as pools and exchanges.

1. DO NOT run several wallet processes on the same wallet.db file EVER. 

2. Do not do listen and send at the same time using CLI wallet (even from two
   shells)

3. Do not copy the wallet.db to another machine and run another wallet
   simultaneously

4. Do not run two different wallets with the same seed at the same time

5. SBBS messages sent between wallets expire after 12 hours. You have to
   connect within 12 hours of the transaction initiation to receive or send
   the funds.

6. SBBS Addresses by default expire after 24 hours. Always use 'never'
   expiring addresses with pools and exchanges to make sure you receive
   payments.

CLI Wallet is not built for scale operation. Test your setup carefully to
avoid problems for you and your users
